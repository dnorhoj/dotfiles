# US intl. danish layout for xkb

This is my own custom keyboard layout for xkb. I call it: `English (US intl., with AltGr dead keys, danish)`.

The layout can be added by copying `./custom` into `/usr/share/X11/xkb/symbols/custom`.

The keyboard layout can be enabled by using the following command:

```bash
setxkbmap -layout custom
```

It can also be added to gnome by enabling `Keyboard > Show Extended Input Sources` in gnome tweaks, and adding it to the gnome keyboard layouts.
